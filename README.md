College students struggle to keep track of what they’re eating and often resort to simple, often unhealthy meals when they’re feeling lazy or uninspired; our app aims to couteract that! Through noms, we aim to help users make healthier eating habits by keeping track of their daily meals, and finding inspiration socially through what other people are eating or making.



## Home Screen
When opening the app, users are brought to a homescreen where they can view the three most recent "noms", or meals, of their friends. To see additional details of a friend's particular meal, users can click on the friend's profile arrow which brings them to a more detailed explanation of the meal, including the meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner), a short meal summary, and a larger, scrollable photo of the dish.

## Meal-Planning

To add a meal to their future meal plan, users can click the large plus button on the right hand corner, and assign a nom name, description, meal type, and an iaage url that adds the nom to their meal plan for that date.

Users can then view their current weekly meal plan by selecting the "Plan" option on the navigation bar, bringing them to a collective view of their current noms for the week that can be further categorized when selecting a date as well.

## Favoriting and Saving noms

On the homescreen, users have the option to like or save any noms they want to view for later. These noms can then be viewed in the "Saved" view.

## Future Work

A majority of this app is purely front-end, and still needs to be conencted to the back-end. Moving foward, many features would need to be implemented to their proper functionality!

This project was awarded Best UI for the 2024 AppDev Hack Challenge. (:
