Through noms, we aim to help users make healthier eating habits by keeping track of their daily meals, and finding inspiration socially through what other people are eating/making. College students struggle to keep track of what they’re eating and often resort to simple, often unhealthy meals when they’re feeling lazy or uninspired; our app aims to couteract that.
